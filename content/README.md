# Impact List Data Structure

This directory contains all the data for the Impact List application in a maintainable format using markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

## Directory Structure

- `/categories/`: Contains one file per effectiveness category with its name and effects configuration
- `/donors/`: Contains one file per donor with their information
- `/recipients/`: Contains one file per recipient organization with their information and category allocations
- `/donations/`: Contains files that list donation events, typically organized by donor name, though any donation can appear in any file
- `globalParameters.md`: Contains global simulation parameters

## File Formats

### Global Parameters

The `globalParameters.md` file contains system-wide simulation parameters:

```yaml
---
discountRate: 0.00
populationGrowthRate: 0.01
timeLimit: 100 # time after which we don't consider effects on the future
populationLimit: 10 # as a multiple of today's population
currentPopulation: 8_100_000_000
yearsPerLife: 80
---
```

### Categories

Each category file (e.g., `global_health.md`) defines how donations to that category affect lives saved. Categories use an effects-based system that models impact over time.

There are two types of effects:

#### Standard Effects (for health/development interventions):

```yaml
---
id: global-health
name: 'Global Health'
effects:
  - effectId: standard
    startTime: 1
    windowLength: 40
    costPerQALY: 62.5
---
```

Parameters for standard effects:

- `effectId`: Unique identifier for the effect
- `startTime`: Years from donation until effect begins
- `windowLength`: Duration of the effect in years
- `costPerQALY`: Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year
- `validTimeInterval`: [start_year, end_year] when this effect applies (optional -- omit for unbounded)

#### Population-level Effects (for existential/catastrophic risks):

```yaml
---
id: ai-risk
name: 'AI Existential Risk'
effects:
  - effectId: population-early
    startTime: 50
    windowLength: 1_000_000_000_000
    costPerMicroprobability: 800_000
    populationFractionAffected: 1.0
    qalyImprovementPerYear: 1.0
    validTimeInterval: [null, 2012]
  - effectId: population-medium
    startTime: 30
    windowLength: 1_000_000_000_000
    costPerMicroprobability: 400_000
    populationFractionAffected: 1.0
    qalyImprovementPerYear: 1.0
    validTimeInterval: [2013, 2021]
  - effectId: population-late
    startTime: 10
    windowLength: 1_000_000_000_000
    costPerMicroprobability: 200_000
    populationFractionAffected: 1.0
    qalyImprovementPerYear: 1.0
    validTimeInterval: [2022, null]
---
```

Parameters for population-level effects:

- `effectId`: Unique identifier for the effect
- `startTime`: Years from donation until effect begins
- `windowLength`: Duration of the effect in years
- `costPerMicroprobability`: Cost per one-in-a-million chance reduction
- `populationFractionAffected`: Fraction of population affected (0-1)
- `qalyImprovementPerYear`: Quality of life improvement/harm per year. 1 is the difference between a normal life and being dead.
- `validTimeInterval`: [start_year, end_year] when this effect applies (optional -- omit for unbounded)

### Donors

Each donor file (e.g., `bill_gates.md`) contains donor information:

```yaml
---
id: 'bill-gates'
name: 'Bill Gates'
netWorth: 108_000_000_000
totalDonated: 59_000_000_000 # optional, you usually don't want to add this but instead rely on the system to add up all their donations
---
```

### Recipients

Each recipient file (e.g., `against_malaria_foundation.md`) maps the organization to categories:

```yaml
---
id: against-malaria-foundation
name: 'Against Malaria Foundation'
categories:
  - id: global-health
    fraction: 1.0
---
```

For recipients with multiple categories:

```yaml
---
id: gates-foundation
name: 'Gates Foundation'
categories:
  - id: global-health
    fraction: 0.4
  - id: global-development
    fraction: 0.3
  - id: climate-change
    fraction: 0.07
  - id: education
    fraction: 0.08
  - id: pandemics
    fraction: 0.07
  - id: science-tech
    fraction: 0.05
  - id: human-rights
    fraction: 0.03
---
```

Recipients can override category effect parameters:

```yaml
---
id: internet-archive
name: 'Internet Archive'
categories:
  - id: science-tech
    fraction: 1
    effects:
      - effectId: standard
        overrides:
          costPerQALY: 750
---
```

Recipients can also apply multipliers to category effects:

```yaml
---
id: khan-academy
name: 'Khan Academy'
categories:
  - id: education
    fraction: 1
    effects:
      - effectId: standard
        multipliers:
          costPerQALY: 0.1 # 10x more effective than category default
---
```

Note: Some recipients can have negative cost per life values (in `ai-capabilities` category), meaning donations to them may increase existential risk.

### Donations

Each file in the donations directory (typically named after a donor, like `bill_gates.md`) contains multiple donation events:

```yaml
---
donations:
  - date: 1991-10-07
    recipient: university-of-washington-research
    amount: 12_000_000
    credit:
      bill-gates: 1.0
    source: 'https://www.washington.edu/news/1991/10/07/bill-gates-gives-uw-12-million-to-create-biotech-department/'
    notes: 'Initial endowment' # Optional

  - date: 1995-01-01
    recipient: university-of-washington
    amount: 10_000_000
    credit:
      bill-gates: 0.5
      melinda-gates: 0.5
    source: 'https://www.washington.edu/news/1999/10/28/uw-awarded-10-million-from-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation/'
---
```

We also support joint donations from multiple people. For instance:

```yaml
# In larry_page.md and mark_zuckerberg.md
---
donations:
  - date: 2014-11-10
    recipient: ebola-relief-efforts
    amount: 45_000_000
    credit:
      larry-page: 0.33
      mark-zuckerberg: 0.67
    source: 'https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/google-larry-page-pledge-30-million-for-ebola-relief-efforts'
    notes: 'Joint tech sector response to Ebola crisis'
---
```

A donationfrom anyone can technically appear in any donor file.
For maintainability, always put a donation from person X in person X's file.
There's a special donation file for multiple donors called multiple_donors.md.

## Data Generation

After updating these files, run the data generation script to create the JavaScript data file:

```bash
node scripts/generate-data.js
```

This will create/update `src/data/generatedData.js` with the compiled data from all markdown files. The script handles deduplication of donation events that appear in multiple files.
