## What is the probability of AI-caused human extinction this century?

This document analyzes the baseline probability that artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI) will cause human extinction before 2100. This probability is commonly referred to as "p(doom)" in AI safety discussions.

**Summary:** We estimate the baseline probability of AI-caused extinction this century at approximately **8%**, with a plausible range of **2-25%**. This reflects a rough synthesis of expert surveys, superforecaster estimates, public statements from leading AI researchers, and academic analyses of existential risk. We note substantial disagreement among experts, with some prominent researchers placing the probability near zero and others above 25%.

## 1. What the Experts Say

A range of expert surveys, public statements, and academic analyses provide estimates of AI-caused extinction risk. These vary considerably—from near zero to over 50%—but the most common estimates among those who have studied the question fall in the 5-20% range.

### 1.1 Expert Surveys

**Grace et al. 2024 ("Thousands of AI Authors on the Future of AI")**

[Grace et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843), the largest survey of its kind, collected responses from 2,778 researchers who had published in top-tier AI venues. Key findings:

- The median probability assigned to AI causing "extremely bad" outcomes (human extinction or similarly permanent disempowerment) was approximately **5%**.
- The mean probability was higher at approximately **14%**, indicating a right-skewed distribution with some researchers giving very high estimates.
- Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction.
- Researchers who had published specifically on AI safety or alignment tended to give higher estimates.

**AI Impacts 2022 Survey**

The [2022 Expert Survey on Progress in AI](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) by AI Impacts surveyed hundreds of machine learning researchers. The median probability assigned to "extremely bad" outcomes conditional on human-level machine intelligence being achieved was **5-10%**, with a substantial minority giving estimates above 25%.

**Methodological Concerns**

Some researchers have [raised concerns](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-survey-exaggerates-apocalyptic-risks/) about these surveys, including:

- Potential selection bias (researchers concerned about AI safety may be more likely to respond)
- Framing effects (questions that assume transformative AI will be built may bias responses)
- The surveys have been partially funded by organizations associated with effective altruism, which has historically emphasized AI existential risk

Thomas Dietterich, former president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, declined to participate in AI Impacts' survey, noting that "many of the questions are asked from the AI-doomer, existential-risk perspective."

### 1.2 Superforecaster Estimates

The [Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT)](https://forecastingresearch.org/research), conducted by the Forecasting Research Institute in 2022, brought together domain experts and superforecasters (individuals with track records of accurate predictions on shorter-term questions).

Key findings:

- **Domain experts**: Median estimate of **6%** for AI-caused human extinction by 2100
- **Superforecasters**: Median estimate of **1%** for AI-caused human extinction by 2100

Superforecasters were considerably more optimistic than domain experts across all existential risk categories, with the largest disagreement being about AI risk. Despite months of structured debate and incentives to persuade each other, neither group substantially changed their views.

A [separate superforecaster analysis](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FWEKtG5k9qpKnnBmZ/superforecasting-the-premises-in-is-power-seeking-ai-an) of Joseph Carlsmith's arguments for AI existential risk found superforecasters gave approximately 1% probability to existential catastrophe from power-seeking AI by 2070, compared to Carlsmith's own estimate of 5%.

### 1.3 Public Statements from Leading Researchers

Several prominent AI researchers have publicly shared their estimates:

**Geoffrey Hinton** (Turing Award winner, Nobel Prize in Physics 2024)

In December 2024, [Hinton told the BBC](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/27/godfather-of-ai-raises-odds-of-the-technology-wiping-out-humanity-over-next-30-years) that he estimates a **10-20%** probability of AI causing human extinction within the next 30 years, noting that AI development is proceeding "much faster" than he expected.

**Dario Amodei** (CEO, Anthropic)

In September 2025, [Amodei stated at the Axios AI+ DC Summit](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/anthropic-dario-amodei-p-doom-25-percent) that he estimates a **25%** probability of things going "really, really badly" with AI. While he noted this includes scenarios short of extinction, his framing suggested catastrophic outcomes are a significant component.

**Yoshua Bengio** (Turing Award winner)

Bengio has publicly stated he assigns roughly **10-20%** probability to AI-caused catastrophe this century and has advocated for AI safety measures and governance.

**Stuart Russell** (UC Berkeley, author of leading AI textbook)

Russell has stated he assigns approximately **10%** probability to AI-caused existential catastrophe and has been a leading voice arguing for AI safety.

**Yann LeCun** (Turing Award winner, Chief AI Scientist at Meta)

LeCun has been a prominent skeptic of existential risk claims. He has called the idea of AI posing an existential risk ["preposterous"](https://time.com/6694432/yann-lecun-meta-ai-interview/) and argues that AI can be made safe through iterative refinement, similar to how we made aircraft reliable. He believes AI systems will have no inherent desire to take control and that we can design them to be safe and steerable by default.

**Melanie Mitchell** (Santa Fe Institute, author of "Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans")

Mitchell has [stated her view](https://www.aei.org/articles/a-quick-qa-with-ai-researcher-melanie-mitchell/) that "the risk of wiping out humanity is very low" and "almost vanishingly small" compared to other risks. She argues that AI systems lack the common-sense reasoning, genuine understanding, and self-directed agency that would be required to pose existential threats. At the [2023 Munk Debate](https://thehub.ca/podcast/audio/is-ai-an-existential-threat-yann-lecun-max-tegmark-melanie-mitchell-and-yoshua-bengio-make-their-case/), she stated that the "bad actor scenario is the only plausible one" for AI-related catastrophic risk.

### 1.4 Academic Risk Assessments

**Toby Ord, "The Precipice" and "The Precipice Revisited"**

Philosopher Toby Ord, in his book [_The Precipice_](https://theprecipice.com/) (2020) and his 2024 talk ["The Precipice Revisited"](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/the-precipice-revisited), estimates the probability of existential catastrophe from unaligned AI this century at approximately **10%**. In recent [interviews](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/toby-ord-inference-scaling-ai-governance/), Ord has noted uncertainty about whether recent developments have increased or decreased this estimate, citing the shift to language models (which he sees as a positive development for safety) alongside increased racing dynamics between companies.

**Severin Field (2025), "Why do Experts Disagree on Existential Risk and P(doom)?"**

A [2025 survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14870) of 111 AI experts found that experts cluster into two distinct viewpoints: an "AI as controllable tool" perspective (associated with low p(doom)) and an "AI as uncontrollable agent" perspective (associated with high p(doom)). Notably, only 21% of surveyed experts had heard of "instrumental convergence," a fundamental concept in AI safety arguments. The least concerned participants were also the least familiar with AI safety concepts.

## 2. Sources of AI-Caused Extinction Risk

The concern is not that AI systems will spontaneously decide to harm humans for no reason, but rather that sufficiently capable AI systems optimizing for goals that are subtly misaligned with human values could cause catastrophic harm as a side effect of pursuing those goals.

### 2.1 The Alignment Problem

The core technical challenge is that we do not yet have robust methods to ensure that powerful AI systems will pursue goals aligned with human values. Key failure modes include:

**Specification failures**: Goals that sound reasonable may have unintended interpretations. A system told to "maximize human happiness" might find that modifying humans directly is more efficient than improving their circumstances.

**Reward hacking**: AI systems may learn to achieve high scores on their objective function in ways that don't capture what we actually wanted. For example, a content recommendation system optimizing for "engagement" might learn that outrage and addiction are the easiest paths to high engagement.

**Goal misgeneralization**: An AI system may learn a goal in training that works well in the training environment but generalizes poorly to new situations.

### 2.2 Instrumental Convergence

Nick Bostrom and others have argued that sufficiently capable AI systems pursuing almost any goal would be expected to develop certain "instrumental subgoals":

- **Self-preservation**: A system can't achieve its goals if it's turned off.
- **Resource acquisition**: More resources generally help achieve more goals.
- **Goal preservation**: A system will resist having its goals changed.
- **Self-improvement**: A more capable system can better achieve its goals.

These drives could lead even a system with benign goals to resist shutdown or prevent humans from correcting its behavior. However, critics note that only 21% of AI researchers surveyed had even heard of this concept, suggesting it may not be as widely accepted as proponents assume.

### 2.3 Speed and Power Differentials

If AI systems become significantly more capable than humans in relevant domains, the power differential could make it difficult for humans to course-correct if things go wrong. This is particularly concerning because:

- AI capabilities may advance faster than our ability to verify alignment
- Competition between labs or nations may create pressure to deploy systems before adequate safety testing
- Once a sufficiently capable unaligned system is deployed, it may be too late to undo the damage

## 3. Arguments for Lower Probability Estimates

Some researchers assign significantly lower probabilities (<3%) to AI-caused extinction. Their arguments include:

**Technical optimism about alignment**

[Yann LeCun argues](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1795032310590378405) that "AI is not some sort of natural phenomenon that will just emerge and become dangerous. _WE_ design it and _WE_ build it." He contends that just as we made turbojets "insanely reliable" before widespread deployment, we can engineer AI systems to be safe and controllable. LeCun believes there likely exists at least one design for AI systems that is simultaneously safe, controllable, and highly capable.

**Current systems lack key dangerous properties**

[Melanie Mitchell argues](https://buildingcreativemachines.substack.com/p/the-fallacy-of-dumb-superintelligence) that current AI systems lack common-sense reasoning, genuine understanding, and the capacity for self-directed agency. She notes that AI systems today "have no agency of their own" and cannot spontaneously acquire the kind of strategic long-term planning required to pose existential threats. The leap from current narrow AI to dangerous superintelligence seems implausible under current technological paradigms.

**Superforecaster skepticism**

The [Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament](https://forecastingresearch.org/research) found that superforecasters—individuals selected for their track record of accurate predictions—gave much lower probability estimates (median 1%) than domain experts (median 6%) for AI-caused extinction. Superforecasters may be less prone to base rate neglect and more calibrated in their probability assessments, though they may also underweight novel risks without historical precedent.

**Economic and social constraints**

Real-world deployment of AI systems faces many constraints. Regulators, insurers, users, and civil society provide checks that could catch problems before they become existential. AI development is not happening in a vacuum but within existing institutional structures.

**Multiple opportunities for course correction**

The path from current AI to superintelligent AI likely involves many intermediate stages. Each stage provides opportunities to identify and correct alignment problems. Warning signs would likely emerge before catastrophic capabilities are achieved.

**Historical track record**

Predictions of imminent catastrophe from new technologies have often been wrong. Many worried about nuclear power causing widespread disaster, genetic engineering creating uncontrollable plagues, or nanotechnology producing "grey goo"—scenarios that have not materialized.

## 4. Arguments for Higher Probability Estimates

Other researchers assign significantly higher probabilities (>15%) to AI-caused extinction. Their arguments include:

**Speed of capability gains**

Recent advances in AI (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, reasoning models like o1 and o3) have surprised even optimistic forecasters. The [Grace et al. 2024 survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843) found that researchers' median estimate for when machines could outperform humans at every possible task moved from 2060 to 2047 in just one year—a 13-year shift.

**Competitive dynamics**

AI development is occurring in a highly competitive environment (US-China competition, lab vs. lab racing). This creates pressure to deploy systems quickly, potentially cutting corners on safety. As Toby Ord has [noted](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/the-precipice-revisited), "In 2023, something new happened. It became not just a race between these labs, but a race between the largest companies on Earth."

**Complexity of human values**

Human values are enormously complex, context-dependent, and not fully understood even by humans. Specifying them precisely enough for an AI system may be intractable. Even "helpful" and "harmless" can conflict in ways that are difficult to resolve.

**No second chances**

Unlike most technologies, superintelligent AI may provide no opportunity for learning from mistakes. If the first superintelligent AI is misaligned, there may be no chance to try again.

**Difficulty of verifying alignment**

We currently lack reliable methods to verify that an AI system is truly aligned with human values rather than merely appearing aligned during testing. A system could behave well during evaluation while pursuing different objectives once deployed at scale.

## 5. Our Point Estimate: 8%

Given the range of expert opinions and analyses, we adopt a baseline estimate of **8%** probability of AI-caused extinction this century. This is:

- **Below the mean of expert surveys** (which cluster around 10-15%), reflecting weight given to superforecaster skepticism and technical critiques
- **Above superforecaster estimates** (~1%), reflecting the possibility that superforecasters may underweight novel risks and may have less technical understanding of AI systems
- **Consistent with many prominent individual estimates** from researchers like Ord, Hinton, Russell, and Bengio
- **Acknowledging deep uncertainty**: Reasonable people examining the same evidence arrive at estimates from <1% to >30%

We emphasize that this is a **rough estimate subject to large uncertainty**. The 8% figure should be understood as a working assumption for cost-effectiveness analysis, not a confident prediction.

### Plausible Range

We suggest a plausible range of **2-25%** for AI-caused extinction risk this century:

- **2%** represents an estimate giving substantial weight to superforecaster skepticism, the arguments of technical optimists like LeCun and Mitchell, and the possibility that alignment may prove more tractable than feared.
- **25%** represents an estimate consistent with the higher end of expert concern, accounting for rapid capability gains, competitive pressures, and fundamental uncertainty about alignment.

## 6. Key Uncertainties and Disagreements

The major sources of uncertainty in this estimate include:

**1. Timeline to transformative AI**

Estimates range from <10 years to >50 years. If transformative AI is far away, current estimates may be less relevant; if it's close, we have less time to prepare.

**2. Tractability of alignment**

Optimists argue alignment will be solved "by default" as we make systems more capable and useful. Pessimists argue it's fundamentally difficult and current approaches are inadequate.

**3. Forecaster type disagreement**

The large gap between domain expert estimates (~6% median) and superforecaster estimates (~1% median) is striking. Either superforecasters are underweighting a genuine risk due to lack of domain knowledge, or domain experts are overweighting the risk due to selection effects and motivated reasoning.

**4. Definitional ambiguity**

Different people use "p(doom)" to refer to different outcomes (human extinction vs. catastrophic harm vs. permanent disempowerment) over different time horizons. This makes direct comparisons difficult.

**5. Unknown unknowns**

There may be important considerations we haven't thought of that would significantly shift the estimate in either direction.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The probability of AI-caused human extinction this century is deeply uncertain, with expert estimates ranging from near zero to over 30%. The available evidence suggests substantial disagreement, with a rough central tendency around 5-15% among those who have studied the question.

We adopt 8% as our working estimate, with a plausible range of 2-25%, recognizing that this reflects genuine uncertainty rather than confidence. Users who believe the risk is higher or lower can adjust the parameter accordingly in the cost-effectiveness model.

The disagreement between superforecasters and domain experts is particularly notable and unresolved. This suggests that either traditional forecasting methods underweight novel risks, or domain expertise in AI safety systematically biases toward higher risk estimates—or both.
