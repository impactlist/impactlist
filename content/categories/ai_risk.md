# Justification of cost per life

Assume that with our past spending of roughly a billion dollars on AI safety we've reduced existential risk by about 0.5%. Assume the marginal value of the next dollars in this area is the same
as with the first billion. Then the cost per microprobability (one in a million chance) is $200,000.

Disagree? This project hasn't officially launched yet and we're looking for help improving our cost per life estimates.

# Internal Notes

https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/ argues the cost is about $1000, but maybe $100, counting existing people

We've already spent between 600 million and a billion dollars on AI safety. Assume we've reduced xrisk by 1%. Assume the marginal value of the next billion is the same.

So 1 billion --> 1% chance of saving 8 billion people --> 80 million lives in EV... but each person's life is already half over, so 40 million lives for a billion, or $25 per life.

Note that this assumes that in a good AI future our longevity is not increased at all -- everyone just lives a normally long life, of equal quality to their life now.
But in reality a good AGI outcome would likely significantly extend our lives, possibly up to a trillion years or more.

If people lived a million years on average after a good AGI outcome, then that multiplies the lives by 12500, $25/12500 = $0.002

Each person lives a billion years --> $0.000002
