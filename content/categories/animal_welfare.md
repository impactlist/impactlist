# Justification of cost per life

GPT o3 estimates $1 for 500 chicken years. Assume a chicken year is a 100k times less valuable than a human year.
That's $1 for 0.005 human years, or $1000 per 5 human years, or $16,000 per life.

This project hasn't officially launched yet and we're looking for help improving our cost per life estimates.
