# Justification of cost per life

_The following analysis was done on November 12th 2025. It was written by GPT 5 Thinking and edited by Impact List staff for brevity._

We arrive at the cost per life by estimating the cost per [QALY (quality adjusted life-year)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year), and multiplying this by the our hardcoded value for how many years make up a life (80 at the time of this writing).

**Point estimate:** **\$700 per QALY**  
**Range (plausible):** **\$20–\$30,000 per QALY**

## Details

**What’s in scope.**  
This category excludes climate mitigation. It covers **pollution control and environmental health** (e.g., lead exposure elimination, PM₂.₅/NOₓ/ozone air-quality policy), **toxic-site remediation**, and **habitat/greenspace protection and restoration** where human health is a primary or material co-benefit.

**Why these opportunities can be very cost-effective.**

- **Lead exposure elimination (regulation & enforcement).** Lead in paint, ceramics, spices and industrial sources imposes a massive health burden—**~22 million DALYs annually**, mostly in LMICs ([Rethink Priorities, 2021](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/global-lead-exposure-report/)). Donor leverage is high: the **Lead Exposure Elimination Project (LEEP)** reports an updated expectation of **~\$4.49 per DALY-equivalent averted** across programs ([LEEP CEA, 2024](https://leadelimination.org/how-cost-effective-are-leeps-paint-programs/)), with independent case studies of **hot-spot cleanups** showing **\$392–\$3,238 per DALY** ([Ericson et al., 2018, GeoHealth](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7007121/) and publisher page; summary on [Pure Earth](https://www.pureearth.org/global-lead-program/research/)). Major EA funders have supported this area (e.g., [GiveWell → Pure Earth, 2021](https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/Pure-Earth-lead-exposure-July-2021/August-2021-version); Open Philanthropy discusses its BOTECs and valuation framework for lead in recent notes: [Open Phil, 2025](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-we-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-in-our-grantmaking/)).

- **Clean air policy and enforcement (non-GHG pollutants).** Fine-particle pollution is a leading health risk. Systematic reviews find that **the health benefits of air-pollution control strategies typically exceed their costs**, driven by mortality and morbidity reductions ([Wang et al., 2024](https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41256-024-00373-y); also see methodological reviews: [Vandenbulcke et al., 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/22/6/926) and UK/US regulatory analyses, e.g., [Hubbell 2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-004-7437-1)). Population-wide exposure reductions translate into large **QALY** gains: recent estimates suggest that sizable PM₂.₅ reductions can add **months of life expectancy** on average ([Lin et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00953-w)). Philanthropic neglectedness remains high ([Clean Air Fund funding reports](https://www.cleanairfund.org/resource/air-quality-funding-2025/)), increasing the odds that donor advocacy can be pivotal.

- **Toxic-site cleanup.** Evidence links hazardous-waste cleanups to improved birth outcomes and child development (e.g., **Superfund** cleanups and cohorts in the U.S.: research summary [American University, 2019](https://www.american.edu/spa/news/evidence-shows-costly-superfund-cleanup-worth-the-investment.cfm)). While cost-per-QALY estimates vary by site, the direction of effect (reduced neurotoxicity and cardiometabolic disease) is clear.

**Where cost-effectiveness is weaker (upper end of the range).**

- **Habitat/greenspace primarily for amenity.** Conservation and urban greening likely improve mental and physical health, but the **QALY evidence base is thinner and mixed**. Macro-valuations suggest enormous mental-health value of nature ([Buckley et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6851373/); [Buckley et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632072200218X)), yet **program-level CEAs** sometimes fail standard cost-effectiveness thresholds (e.g., a UK park-renovation CEA **~£207,000 per QALY**; summary in [Love-Koh et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673617329963); and mixed findings in a 2024 systematic review of green-space interventions: [Raza et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11594178/)).
- **Plastic-cleanup technologies** can have uncertain net benefits and sometimes risk ecological harm if poorly designed ([Falk-Andersson et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501118/)).

**Bringing the strands together.**

- At the **very low end**, top pollution-control charities (e.g., LEEP; targeted hot-spot remediation) can plausibly deliver **single- to low-double-digit dollars per QALY**.
- **Policy advocacy and enforcement** for clean air often yields **large health gains at low cost**, suggesting **\$<1,000 per QALY** in favorable contexts, though transparent QALY-based CEAs remain scarce.
- **Amenity-first habitat projects** can be **>\$20,000 per QALY** when measured strictly on health outcomes.

Weighting toward the **best-evidenced, health-first opportunities** in this cause area and down-weighting projects with primarily non-health goals yields a conservative **point estimate of ~\$700 per QALY**, with a **very wide plausible range of ~\$20–\$30,000 per QALY** reflecting the heavy-tailed distribution of opportunities and uncertainties in policy attribution and durability.
