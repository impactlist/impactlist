# Justification of cost per life

_The following analysis was done on November 26th 2025, written by GPT 5.1 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini Pro 3.0, and edited by Impact List staff for clarity._

## Description of effect

This effect captures quality-adjusted life-years gained through donations to top-rated global health charities, primarily those preventing child mortality via interventions such as malaria prevention, vitamin A supplementation, and immunization incentives.

## Point Estimates

- **Cost per QALY:** \$90 (\$30–\$200)
- **Start time:** 1 year
- **Duration:** 60 years

## Assumptions

1. Remaining life expectancy for children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa is approximately 60 years. ([World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=ZG))
2. DALYs averted and QALYs gained are approximately equivalent for child-survival interventions targeting infectious diseases.
3. GiveWell's cost-effectiveness analyses accurately reflect the impact of donations to their top-recommended global health charities: AMF, Malaria Consortium (SMC), Helen Keller International (VAS), and New Incentives. ([GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models))
4. These four charities represent the current "best buys" in effective altruism-vetted global health funding. ([GiveWell Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities))
5. It takes approximately one year for funds to be allocated, supplies procured, and interventions delivered in this area.
6. Benefits accrue over the remaining lifespan of individuals whose deaths are averted.

## Details

### Cost per QALY

The point estimate (\$90/QALY) and range (\$30–\$200/QALY) are derived from GiveWell's cost-effectiveness models for their top-recommended charities (Assumption 3). These organizations focus primarily on averting deaths among children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa.

GiveWell typically reports cost per death averted or DALYs per dollar. To convert cost per death averted to cost per QALY, we multiply deaths averted by remaining life expectancy (60 years, per Assumption 1). World Bank data shows life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa at approximately 63 years; starting from early childhood, 60 remaining years is a reasonable estimate. We treat DALYs averted as roughly equivalent to QALYs gained for these interventions (Assumption 2).

The wide range (\$30–\$200/QALY) reflects variation across countries, insecticide resistance patterns, baseline mortality rates, program execution quality, and counterfactual funding flows. Recent GiveWell analyses informing these estimates include grants for [AMF bed net distribution](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/AMF-LLIN-DRC-June-2024) and [Malaria Consortium SMC expansion](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/Malaria-Consortium-SMC-Expansion-in-Chad-June-2025).

### Start Time

The one-year start time reflects the typical delay between donation and program implementation (Assumption 5).

### Duration

The 60-year duration matches the estimated remaining life expectancy for beneficiaries (Assumption 1), over which health benefits accrue (Assumption 6).
