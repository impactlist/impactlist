# Justification of cost per life

_The following analysis was done on November 12th 2025. It was written by GPT 5 Thinking and edited by Impact List staff for brevity._

We arrive at the cost per life by estimating the cost per [QALY (quality adjusted life-year)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year), and multiplying this by the our hardcoded value for how many years make up a life (80 at the time of this writing).

**Point estimate:** **\$25,000 per QALY**  
**Range (plausible):** **\$20,000–\$60,000 per QALY**

## Details

**What’s included.**  
“Homelessness & Housing” in wealthy nations covers programs like **temporary financial assistance/rapid rehousing**, **homelessness prevention**, **permanent supportive housing (Housing First)**, and **hospital–to–home discharge teams**. These interventions improve survival, reduce acute care use, and raise health-related quality of life, which together translate into QALYs.

**Direct cost-per-QALY evidence (high-quality, recent).**

- **Temporary Financial Assistance (TFA) / Rapid Rehousing (U.S. Veterans):** A 2024 economic evaluation of the VA’s Supportive Services for Veteran Families program found **\$22,676 per QALY** overall, **\$19,114 per QALY** for rapid rehousing, and **\$29,751 per QALY** for homelessness prevention over a 2-year horizon ([JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825636); open access summary: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11539017/)).

- **Stable housing for people experiencing homelessness with opioid use disorder:** A 2025 model estimated **\$27,300 per QALY** (lifetime horizon), with sensitivity analyses in the **\$20k–\$33k** range ([JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835706)).

- **Hospital discharge teams for people who are homeless (UK “Pathway” model):** A randomized trial reported a **£26,000 per QALY** cost-effectiveness ratio (approx. low-\$30k at typical exchange rates) and improved post-discharge quality of life ([PubMed abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27251910/); trial materials: [Oxford ORA PDF](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3A55c8cf85-151e-455e-9910-fddec47dc6c1/files/mea6cc822f9884567130a55bd13a9c2db)).

- **Rental assistance for people living with HIV (U.S.):** Earlier cost-utility work estimated **\$62,493 per QALY** ([AIDS & Behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22588529/)), illustrating that costs rise in populations needing intensive, disease-specific support.

**Economic cross-checks (not QALY-based).**  
A CDC/Community Guide systematic economic review of **Permanent Supportive Housing (Housing First)** found a median U.S. **program cost of \$16,479/person-year** and a **benefit-to-cost ratio ~1.8:1** (societal perspective), indicating substantial **cost offsets** even before valuing QALYs ([AJPM review via PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8863642/); summary PDF: [The Community Guide](https://thecommunityguide.org/media/pdf/he-ajpm-ecrev-housing-first.pdf)). While not a QALY result, these offsets help explain why several QALY-based studies above land in the low tens of thousands per QALY.

**How the estimate was formed.**  
Anchoring on the strongest QALY studies in high-income settings—**\$19k–\$30k per QALY** for rapid rehousing/TFA and for housing with OUD—yields a central tendency around **\$25k per QALY**. Including programs serving particularly complex clinical needs (e.g., HIV) pushes the upper tail toward **\$60k per QALY**. This corridor aligns with independent hospital-discharge team evidence (~**£26k/QALY**). It also sits comfortably within commonly used high-income decision benchmarks (e.g., **£20k–£30k per QALY** in the UK; see [NICE manual](https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg36/resources/nice-health-technology-evaluations-the-manual-pdf-72286779244741)).

**Why the range.**  
Cost-effectiveness varies with (i) **targeting** (higher baseline risk → more QALYs gained), (ii) **program type and intensity** (prevention vs rehousing vs permanent supportive housing), (iii) **time horizon** (2-year vs lifetime modeling), and (iv) **valuation perspective** (some studies include large cost offsets from reduced emergency care and justice involvement). Taken together, these factors produce a defensible **\$20k–\$60k per QALY** envelope around a **\$25k** point estimate.

**Bottom line.**  
When directed to highly effective homelessness/housing programs in rich countries—especially rapid rehousing/temporary financial assistance, well-run Housing First/PSH, and hospital-discharge teams—the best current evidence suggests **health gains at roughly \$25,000 per QALY**, with credible variation across populations and models.
