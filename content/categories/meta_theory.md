# Justification of cost per life

_The following analysis was done on November 16th 2025. It was written by GPT 5 Thinking and edited by Impact List staff for brevity._

This category covers **“Meta and Theory”** charities: organisations that try to **multiply** the impact of other cause areas rather than acting directly.

Canonical examples include:

- **Effective altruism movement building and effective giving**, e.g. local EA groups, 80,000 Hours, Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, and other projects that steer money and talent toward the best opportunities.
- **Theoretical work on effective altruism and longtermism**, e.g. moral philosophy, public-facing books and articles, and conceptual frameworks that encourage impartial altruism, careful reasoning, and concern for future generations.

Importantly, this category **does not include Global Priorities Research** as a separate, technical cause-prioritisation field. That is treated elsewhere. The “theory” here means **normative and conceptual work** that shapes people’s values and decisions, not quantitative modelling of how funders should allocate billions between cause areas.

We treat Meta and Theory as a **normal QALY effect**: it increases the number of QALYs generated by other cause areas per dollar. The QALYs come from:

- Extra **money and talent** moved into highly effective charities and careers (for example, global health, animal welfare, AI existential risk, catastrophic pandemics).
- Deeper **value and worldview changes** (for example, longtermist thinking) that cause people to support more impactful causes over decades.

## Headline estimates

- **Cost per QALY (point estimate):**  
  **\$25 per QALY**

- **Plausible range:**  
  **\$4–\$300 per QALY**

This means that, in expectation, a Meta and Theory charity turns a \$25 donation into about 1 extra QALY of benefit for humans, mostly by changing how other resources are used.

## How Meta and Theory charities create impact

We can split the impact into two overlapping channels:

1. **Movement building and effective giving**

   - Running local groups, conferences, podcasts, and online communities.
   - Encouraging people to donate more and to give to much more effective charities.
   - Helping people switch to higher-impact careers.

2. **Normative and conceptual theory (e.g. effective altruism and longtermism)**
   - Public-facing books (such as Peter Singer’s _The Life You Can Save_ and Will MacAskill’s _What We Owe The Future_), blog posts, talks, and courses.
   - Academic and popular discussions of ideas like impartial concern, cause-neutrality, and the moral importance of future generations.
   - These ideas **shift people’s values**, so they are more willing to give a significant share of their income and to direct their careers toward global problems.

Most of the QALY impact comes from **how these ideas show up in behaviour**: more and better donations, and more and better career choices.

We therefore evaluate Meta and Theory by asking:

> “How many dollars of extra ‘top-charity-equivalent’ impact do we get per dollar spent on Meta and Theory?”

We then convert that into QALYs using existing cost-effectiveness estimates for direct interventions.

## BOTEC 1 – Movement building and effective giving (donation multipliers)

Several independent evaluations of “effective giving” and EA movement-building organisations suggest that they can move **multiple dollars to highly effective charities for each dollar they spend**, even after adjusting for what would have happened anyway.

A few examples:

- **80,000 Hours (career-focused movement building).**  
  In a 2016 analysis, 80,000 Hours estimated that their marginal cost per “impact-adjusted significant plan change” (a measure of substantial changes in career or giving) was under **£250–£500**, while each such plan change generated at least **£7,500** in expected donations to GiveWell-recommended charities, implying at least a **15× donation multiplier** from donations alone ([“Why donate to 80,000 Hours”](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WKkF36bJsH8FmYZkw/why-donate-to-80-000-hours)). This excludes the direct impact of the career change itself, which often dominates.

- **Giving What We Can (GWWC).**  
  A 2023 impact assessment by Nuno Sempere estimated GWWC’s donation multiplier between 2020 and 2022 at about **12.2×**, with a 5th–95th percentile range of **0.8–19.1**. That is, each \$1 spent by GWWC caused around \$12 in extra donations, mostly to highly effective charities ([“My impact assessment of Giving What We Can”](https://forum.nunosempere.com/posts/5Lytcvj7GCSysBtSD/my-impact-assessment-of-giving-what-we-can)).

- **The Life You Can Save (TLYCS).**  
  The EA Infrastructure Fund notes that TLYCS reported **\$23 million in donations moved on a \$1.3 million budget** in 2021, a gross multiplier of **18.5×**. The fund managers’ adjusted estimate is around **16×** after accounting for counterfactuals ([EA Infrastructure Fund June 2023 report](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBnxGAc4NT9aRdEtL/ea-infrastructure-fund-june-2023-grant-recommendations), see the TLYCS section).

These figures are not outliers; they are typical of **well-run, mature effective giving projects**. As a central, conservative value, it is reasonable to assume that **top Meta & Theory movement-building orgs achieve an effective donation multiplier of about 8–10×**, with a plausible range of **3–20×** once we adjust for:

- Donors who would have given somewhere anyway.
- Money going to a mix of very high impact and somewhat lower impact charities.
- Attrition over time.

### Converting donation multipliers to QALYs

To convert this into QALYs, we need a benchmark for **direct charity cost-effectiveness**.

GiveWell’s top global health charities are commonly estimated to **save a life for around \$5,000–\$6,000**, corresponding to roughly **\$120–\$200 per life-year or QALY** if we assume 30–40 years of healthy life saved ([Our World in Data summary](https://ourworldindata.org/cost-effectiveness); see also GiveWell’s [top charity cost-effectiveness analysis](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness)). For simplicity, we take a central benchmark of:

- **\$120 per QALY** for high-quality health interventions.

If a Meta charity has, say, a **10× donation multiplier**, and all moved donations go to charities averaging **\$120 per QALY**, then:

- QALYs per Meta dollar:

  $$
  \text{QALYs per \$} \approx \frac{10}{120} \approx 0.083.
  $$

- Cost per QALY:

  $$
  \text{cost per QALY} \approx \frac{1}{0.083} \approx \$12.
  $$

Even if we weaken this to a **5× effective multiplier** (to reflect counterfactual giving and a mix of targets), we still get:

- QALYs per Meta dollar: $5/120 ≈ 0.042$.
- Cost per QALY: ≈ **\$24**.

This rough calculation suggests that **donation-moving Meta work alone can plausibly achieve something like \$10–\$50 per QALY**, before we even count the impact of career changes.

## BOTEC 2 – Theory and worldview change (e.g. longtermism)

The “Theory” part of this category includes:

- Moral and political philosophy related to effective altruism and longtermism.
- Popular books and articles that present these ideas to a broad audience (for example, Peter Singer’s _The Life You Can Save_ or Will MacAskill’s _What We Owe The Future_).
- Public communication that emphasises impartial concern for all people, cost-effectiveness, and concern for the long-term future.

This work does not usually produce formulae or allocation spreadsheets. Instead, it:

- Changes what people **care about** (for example, more weight on global poverty, animal welfare, or future generations).
- Makes people more open to **radical generosity** (donating 10% of income, choosing “weird” but high-impact careers).
- Provides **shared language and concepts** (e.g. “earning to give”, “existential risk”, “longtermism”) that movement-building groups can use.

Although it is hard to quantify, we can think of theoretical work as **feeding into the same donation and career multipliers** as BOTEC 1:

- Without compelling conceptual work, far fewer people would be motivated to join effective altruism, take the GWWC pledge, or choose careers in AI safety or biosecurity.
- Theories like longtermism arguably shifted **hundreds of millions of dollars** of philanthropic spending toward existential risk reduction, even if the exact share is debatable.

For modelling purposes, we treat theory as:

- Contributing a **significant fraction of the total Meta & Theory effect**, but
- Having **more uncertain and heavy-tailed** returns than straightforward movement-building work.

A conservative way to incorporate it is to assume that:

- Theory-related spending has an **average QALY impact per dollar comparable to the lower end of movement-building work**, say **\$50–\$200 per QALY**, because:
  - Many theoretical projects have little direct influence.
  - A few (books, talks, key essays) can be extremely influential, especially when amplified by movement-building organisations.

---

## Pulling it together: a conservative central estimate

Putting the pieces together:

- **Movement building and effective giving**

  - Central cost-effectiveness: around **\$15–\$40 per QALY**, based on 5–10× effective donation multipliers onto charities at ~\$120/QALY, plus some career effects.

- **Theory and worldview change (excluding technical global priorities research)**
  - More uncertain, but plausibly averages around **\$50–\$200 per QALY**, with a long tail of exceptional hits that are much better.

If we treat the Meta and Theory category as roughly **half movement-building, half theory**, and take a **logarithmic average** across these ranges, we obtain:

- **Point estimate:** **\$25 per QALY**
- **Plausible range:** **\$4–\$300 per QALY**

The low end corresponds to generous assumptions about strong donation multipliers and highly impactful theoretical work that significantly grows the pool of committed effective altruists. The high end corresponds to more pessimistic assumptions where many projects have little effect, and only modest fractions of donations or careers are actually redirected.

Even at the high end, Meta and Theory is **competitive with, or better than, most standard cause areas**, because it acts as a **multiplier on other high-impact work** rather than tackling a single problem directly.

## Start time and duration

Because Meta and Theory work mostly changes **how people give and what careers they choose**, its impact tends to be **delayed but long-lasting**.

### Start time

- **Point estimate:** effects begin to show up after about **5 years**.

**Reasoning:**

- Movement-building projects (local groups, fellowships, podcasts, books) often take **1–3 years** to turn a new person into a substantial donor or to prompt a major career change. Early readers of a book like _Doing Good Better_ or _What We Owe The Future_ often take time to process the ideas and then act.
- Those changed behaviours (pledging to give 10%, switching to a higher-impact job) then ramp up over time as incomes grow and careers develop.

A 5-year start time captures this average lag between funding Meta & Theory and seeing the resulting extra QALYs.

### Duration

- **Point estimate:** impact lasts for about **25 years**.

**Reasoning:**

- Once someone adopts a new **donation habit** (e.g. 10% of income to effective charities), they often keep it for **decades**. Giving What We Can’s pledge, for instance, is framed as a **lifetime commitment** ([pledge details](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge)).
- Similarly, a **career change** triggered by 80,000 Hours or EA ideas tends to shift someone’s impact for the remainder of their working life, which is often 20–30 years.
- Theoretical work that articulates new moral ideas (like longtermism) can also have cultural and intellectual influence over multiple decades, even if specific organisations and tactics evolve.

For modelling, we assume that the **extra QALYs generated by a marginal Meta and Theory donation are spread roughly evenly over 25 years**, starting about 5 years after the donation is made.

## Summary

Meta and Theory charities do not primarily distribute bednets or fund vaccines. Instead, they:

- **Grow and support a community** of people committed to doing as much good as possible.
- **Encourage generosity and careful reasoning**, often through compelling theoretical work on impartiality, cost-effectiveness, and concern for the long-term future.
- **Redirect money and talent** toward the most impactful opportunities across all other cause areas.

Empirical estimates from organisations like 80,000 Hours, Giving What We Can, and The Life You Can Save suggest that:

- Movement-building and effective giving projects can move **5–15 dollars** to highly effective charities per dollar spent.
- Theoretical work is a crucial upstream driver of these changes, enabling people to adopt new values and stick with them for decades.

Under conservative assumptions that:

- Focus only on human QALYs over the next several decades,
- Exclude technical global priorities research (treated separately),
- Allow for many Meta and Theory projects to have little impact,

we estimate that **top Meta and Theory charities achieve around \$25 per QALY** (with a wide uncertainty range of **\$4–\$300 per QALY**), with benefits starting around **5 years** after a donation and continuing for about **25 years**.

_Our current cost per life estimates are very approximate and we are looking for help improving them. Read about how you can contribute [here](https://github.com/impactlist/impactlist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)._
