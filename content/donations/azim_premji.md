# Azim Premji Personal Charitable Donations
#
# GIVING OVERVIEW:
# Azim Premji (born 1945) is the founder and former chairman of Wipro Limited, one of India's
# largest IT services companies. He is widely regarded as India's most generous philanthropist
# and has been called "India's Bill Gates."
#
# GIVING STRUCTURE - CRITICAL NOTE:
# Unlike many billionaire philanthropists who donate to a variety of causes directly, virtually
# ALL of Azim Premji's charitable giving flows through a SINGLE vehicle: the Azim Premji Foundation.
# He founded this "operating foundation" in 2001 with the explicit purpose of channeling his
# philanthropy. The Foundation runs its own programs (primarily in education) and makes grants
# to partner organizations. As of 2025, the Foundation holds 66% of the economic ownership of
# Wipro Limited through endowment transfers from Premji.
#
# This means that unlike Bill Gates (who gave to universities, hospitals, and many causes before
# creating the Gates Foundation) or Jensen Huang (who gives to Stanford, Oregon State, etc.),
# Premji's documented individual giving consists almost entirely of donations TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION.
#
# Per the user's instructions, we are looking for donations Premji made as an individual (analogous
# to how Gates donated to the Gates Foundation). The grants the Foundation makes to schools,
# hospitals, and NGOs (like the ₹500 crore to CMC Vellore or ₹1,500 crore for Karnataka mid-day
# meals) are Foundation grants, NOT Premji's personal donations, and are excluded from this list.
#
# GIVING PLEDGE:
# In 2013, Premji became the first Indian to sign the Giving Pledge, committing to give away
# the majority of his wealth. He was the third non-American signatory after Richard Branson
# and David Sainsbury.
#
# TOTAL PERSONAL GIVING:
# As of 2025, Premji has irrevocably donated over $29 billion to the Azim Premji Foundation,
# representing 66-67% of Wipro's economic ownership. This makes him one of the most generous
# philanthropists in history.
#
# FOUNDATION FOCUS AREAS:
# - Public school education improvement in rural India
# - Teacher training and capacity development
# - Azim Premji University (established 2010)
# - Healthcare (since 2022)
# - Nutrition and rural livelihoods
# - COVID-19 relief (2020-2021)
