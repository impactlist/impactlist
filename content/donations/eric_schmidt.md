      On November 13, 2019, Eric and Wendy Schmidt announced a $1 billion
      philanthropic commitment across Schmidt Futures and related entities to
      identify, develop, and support global talent “working in service of
      others,” including the Rise program for 15–17-year-olds. Chronicle of
      Philanthropy and other outlets describe this as a pledge that roughly
      doubles their prior lifetime giving. Treated here as an aggregate,
      multi-year commitment to their own philanthropic vehicles rather than a
      single one-time transfer.

      smaller amounts to Schmidt Ocean Institute and the Schmidt Family
      Foundation. This entry records that $358.5M as an additional donation to
      their own foundation; the exact transaction date is not public, so
      2021-01-01 is used as an approximate year marker.
