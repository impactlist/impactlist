    notes: 'Jensen donated 12.6 million shares in 2007 (https://www.benzinga.com/news/education/25/06/45983347/jensen-huang-gave-12-6-million-to-charity-then-nvidias-stock-made-it-billions) which then massively appreciated. To be consistent with other donors we should not give him credit for the appreciated value, but wikipedia says his total share donations are at least two billion.'
