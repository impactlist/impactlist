# Marc Benioff Personal Charitable Donations - MASTER LIST
#
# METHODOLOGY:

# - Donations with working source URLs
# - De-duplicated entries (same donation appearing in multiple files counted once)
#
# EXCLUDED:
# - Salesforce Foundation/Salesforce.org corporate grants (1-1-1 model funds)
# - Impact investments through TIME Ventures (expecting financial returns)

# - Equipment donations made through partnerships (firetrucks, helicopters via Sayre Foundation)
# - Donations where amounts were not publicly disclosed
#
# GIVING STRUCTURE:

#
# TOTAL VERIFIED DONATIONS: 24 entries
# TOTAL AMOUNT: $903,600,000 (plus $2M political campaign contribution)
