# Peter Thiel - Comprehensive Charitable Giving (Chronological)
# (Personal Donations + Thiel Foundation Grants Combined)
#
# METHODOLOGY:
# This file treats the Thiel Foundation as a pass-through vehicle, attributing
# all foundation grants to Thiel personally (similar to treating Gates Foundation
# grants as Bill Gates donations, or Aphorism Foundation grants as Reid Hoffman donations).
# The Thiel Foundation was established in 2006 and is entirely funded by Thiel.
#
# ORDERING:
# Donations are ordered chronologically by start date. For cumulative/multi-year
# entries, the date reflects when giving began. Cumulative totals are noted.
#
# EXCLUSIONS:
# - Political donations (PACs, Super PACs, campaigns) - estimated $35M+ in 2022 alone
# - Personal investments (Facebook, Palantir, etc.)
# - For-profit venture investments through Founders Fund
#
# NOT A GIVING PLEDGE SIGNATORY
#
# TOTAL DOCUMENTED: ~$70M+ (2006-2024)
