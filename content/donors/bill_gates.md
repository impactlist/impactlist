# Notes

As of April 2025 some public estimates put Gates' total donations at 59 billion dollars, but this gives him full credit for donations that occurred when he was married to Melinda French Gates, who seems to have been very influential in the couple's giving. We'll give them each half credit for donations during the time they were married.

# Internal Notes

He roughly donated 20 billion before and after they married, so if you split the remainder betwen them, the result is about 39.5 billion.
